# Fit and validate Gaussian Process models

Fit and validate Gaussian Process models

## Usage

``` r
fit_gau(
  data,
  response,
  predictors,
  predictors_f = NULL,
  background = NULL,
  partition = NULL,
  thr = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  data.frame. Database with response (0,1) and predictors values.

- response:

  character. Column name with species absence-presence data (0,1).

- predictors:

  character. Vector with the column names of quantitative predictor
  variables (i.e. continuous variables). Usage predictors = c("aet",
  "cwd", "tmin")

- predictors_f:

  character. Vector with the column names of qualitative predictor
  variables (i.e. ordinal or nominal variables type). Usage predictors_f
  = c("landform")

- background:

  data.frame. Database with response column only with 0 and predictors
  variables. All column names must be consistent with data

- partition:

  character. Column name with training and validation partition groups.
  If partition = NULL, the model will be validated with the same data
  used for fitting.

- thr:

  character. Threshold used to get binary suitability values (i.e. 0,1),
  useful for threshold-dependent performance metrics. It is possible to
  use more than one threshold type. A vector must be provided for this
  argument. The following threshold criteria are available:

  - lpt: The highest threshold at which there is no omission.

  - equal_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sensitivity and specificity
    are equal.

  - max_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sum of the sensitivity and
    specificity is the highest (aka threshold that maximizes the TSS).

  - max_jaccard: The threshold at which the Jaccard index is the
    highest.

  - max_sorensen: The threshold at which the Sorensen index is the
    highest.

  - max_fpb: The threshold at which FPB (F-measure on
    presence-background data) is highest.

  - sensitivity: Threshold based on a specified sensitivity value. Usage
    thr = c('sensitivity', sens='0.6') or thr = c('sensitivity'). 'sens'
    refers to sensitivity value. If a sensitivity value is not
    specified, the default used is 0.9.

  If more than one threshold type is used they must be concatenated,
  e.g., thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'max_jaccard'), or thr=c('lpt',
  'max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity', sens='0.8'), or thr=c('lpt',
  'max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity'). Function will use all threshold
  criteria if none is specified.

## Value

A list object with:

- model: A "graf" class object. This object can be used for predicting.

- predictors: A tibble with quantitative (c column names) and
  qualitative (f column names) variables use for modeling.

- performance: Performance metrics (see
  [`sdm_eval`](https://sjevelazco.github.io/flexsdm/reference/sdm_eval.md)).
  Threshold dependent metrics are calculated based on the threshold
  criteria specified in the argument.

- performance_part: Performance metric for each replica and partition
  (see
  [`sdm_eval`](https://sjevelazco.github.io/flexsdm/reference/sdm_eval.md)).

- data_ens: Predicted suitability for each test partition. This database
  is used in
  [`fit_ensemble`](https://sjevelazco.github.io/flexsdm/reference/fit_ensemble.md)

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
data("abies")

# Using k-fold partition method
abies2 <- part_random(
  data = abies,
  pr_ab = "pr_ab",
  method = c(method = "kfold", folds = 3)
)
abies2

bg <- abies2
bg$pr_ab <- 0


gaup_t1 <- fit_gau(
  data = abies2,
  response = "pr_ab",
  predictors = c("aet", "ppt_jja", "pH", "awc", "depth"),
  predictors_f = c("landform"),
  partition = ".part",
  background = bg,
  thr = c("max_sens_spec", "equal_sens_spec", "max_sorensen")
)

gaup_t1$model
gaup_t1$predictors
gaup_t1$performance
gaup_t1$performance_part
gaup_t1$data_ens

# Using bootstrap partition method only with presence-absence
abies2 <- part_random(
  data = abies,
  pr_ab = "pr_ab",
  method = c(method = "boot", replicates = 5, proportion = 0.7)
)
abies2

gaup_t2 <- fit_gau(
  data = abies2,
  response = "pr_ab",
  predictors = c("ppt_jja", "pH", "awc"),
  predictors_f = c("landform"),
  partition = ".part",
  thr = c(type = c("lpt", "max_sens_spec", "sensitivity"), sens = "0.8")
