# Fit and validate Support Vector Machine models with exploration of hyper-parameters that optimize performance

Fit and validate Support Vector Machine models with exploration of
hyper-parameters that optimize performance

## Usage

``` r
tune_svm(
  data,
  response,
  predictors,
  predictors_f = NULL,
  fit_formula = NULL,
  partition,
  grid = NULL,
  thr = NULL,
  metric = "TSS",
  n_cores = 1
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  data.frame. Database with response (0,1) and predictors values.

- response:

  character. Column name with species absence-presence data (0,1).

- predictors:

  character. Vector with the column names of quantitative predictor
  variables (i.e. continuous variables). Usage predictors = c("aet",
  "cwd", "tmin")

- predictors_f:

  character. Vector with the column names of qualitative predictor
  variables (i.e. ordinal or nominal variables type). Usage predictors_f
  = c("landform")

- fit_formula:

  formula. A formula object with response and predictor variables (e.g.
  formula(pr_ab ~ aet + ppt_jja + pH + awc + depth + landform)). Note
  that the variable names used here must be consistent with those used
  in response, predictors, and predictors_f arguments. Default NULL

- partition:

  character. Column name with training and validation partition groups.

- grid:

  data.frame. Provide a data frame object with algorithm
  hyper-parameters values to be tested. It Is recommended to generate
  this data.frame with grid() function. Hyper-parameters needed for
  tuning are 'size' and 'decay'.

- thr:

  character. Threshold used to get binary suitability values (i.e. 0,1).
  It is useful for threshold-dependent performance metrics. It is
  possible to use more than one threshold type. It is necessary to
  provide a vector for this argument. The next threshold area available:

  - lpt: The highest threshold at which there is no omission.

  - equal_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sensitivity and specificity
    are equal.

  - max_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sum of the sensitivity and
    specificity is the highest (aka threshold that maximizes the TSS).

  - max_jaccard: The threshold at which the Jaccard index is the
    highest.

  - max_sorensen: The threshold at which the Sorensen index is highest.

  - max_fpb: The threshold at which \# FPB (F-measure on
    presence-background data) is highest.

  - sensitivity: Threshold based on a specified sensitivity value. Usage
    thr = c('sensitivity', sens='0.6') or thr = c('sensitivity'). 'sens'
    refers to sensitivity value. If a sensitivity value is not
    specified, the default used is 0.9.

  In the case of use more than one threshold type it is necessary
  concatenate threshold types, e.g., thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec',
  'max_jaccard'), or thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity',
  sens='0.8'), or thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity'). Function
  will use all thresholds if no threshold is specified

- metric:

  character. Performance metric used for selecting the best combination
  of hyper-parameter values. One of the following metrics can be used:
  SORENSEN, JACCARD, FPB, TSS, KAPPA, AUC, and BOYCE. TSS is used as
  default.

- n_cores:

  numeric. Number of cores use for parallelization. Default 1

## Value

A list object with:

- model: A "ksvm" class object from kernlab package. This object can be
  used for predicting.

- predictors: A tibble with quantitative (c column names) and
  qualitative (f column names) variables use for modeling.

- performance: Hyper-parameters values and performance metric (see
  [`sdm_eval`](https://sjevelazco.github.io/flexsdm/reference/sdm_eval.md))
  for the best hyper-parameters combination.

- performance_part: Performance metric for each replica and partition
  (see
  [`sdm_eval`](https://sjevelazco.github.io/flexsdm/reference/sdm_eval.md)).

- hyper_performance: Performance metrics (see
  [`sdm_eval`](https://sjevelazco.github.io/flexsdm/reference/sdm_eval.md))
  for each combination of the hyper-parameters.

- data_ens: Predicted suitability for each test partition based on the
  best model. This database is used in
  [`fit_ensemble`](https://sjevelazco.github.io/flexsdm/reference/fit_ensemble.md)

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
data(abies)
abies

# Partition the data with the k-fold method

abies2 <- part_random(
  data = abies,
  pr_ab = "pr_ab",
  method = c(method = "kfold", folds = 5)
)

# pr_ab column is species presence and absences (i.e. the response variable)
# from aet to landform are the predictors variables (landform is a qualitative variable)

# Hyper-parameter values for tuning
tune_grid <-
  expand.grid(
    C = c(2, 4, 8, 16, 20),
    sigma = c(0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)
  )

svm_t <-
  tune_svm(
    data = abies2,
    response = "pr_ab",
    predictors = c(
      "aet", "cwd", "tmin", "ppt_djf",
      "ppt_jja", "pH", "awc", "depth"
    ),
    predictors_f = c("landform"),
    partition = ".part",
    grid = tune_grid,
    thr = "max_sens_spec",
    metric = "TSS",
    n_cores = 1
  )

# Outputs
svm_t$model
svm_t$predictors
svm_t$performance
svm_t$performance_part
svm_t$hyper_performance
svm_t$data_ens
