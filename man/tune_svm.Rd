\usage{
tune_svm(
  data,
  response,
  predictors,
  predictors_f = NULL,
  fit_formula = NULL,
  partition,
  grid = NULL,
  thr = NULL,
  metric = "TSS",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame. Database with response (0,1) and predictors values.}

\item{response}{character. Column name with species absence-presence data (0,1).}

\item{predictors}{character. Vector with the column names of quantitative predictor variables
(i.e. continuous variables). Usage predictors = c("aet", "cwd", "tmin")}

\item{predictors_f}{character. Vector with the column names of qualitative predictor variables
(i.e. ordinal or nominal variables type). Usage predictors_f = c("landform")}

\item{fit_formula}{formula. A formula object with response and predictor
variables (e.g. formula(pr_ab ~ aet + ppt_jja + pH + awc + depth + landform)).
Note that the variable names used here must be consistent with those used in
response, predictors, and predictors_f arguments. Default NULL}

\item{partition}{character. Column name with training and validation partition groups.}

\item{grid}{data.frame. Provide a data frame object with algorithm hyper-parameters values to be
tested. It Is recommended to generate this data.frame with grid() function. Hyper-parameters
 needed for tuning are 'size' and 'decay'.}

\item{thr}{character. Threshold used to get binary suitability values (i.e. 0,1). It is useful
for threshold-dependent performance metrics. It is possible to use more than one threshold type.
It is necessary to provide a vector for this argument. The next threshold area available:
\itemize{
  \item lpt: The highest threshold at which there is no omission.
  \item equal_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sensitivity and specificity are equal.
  \item max_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is the
  highest (aka threshold that maximizes the TSS).
  \item max_jaccard: The threshold at which the Jaccard index is the highest.
  \item max_sorensen: The threshold at which the Sorensen index is highest.
  \item max_fpb: The threshold at which # FPB (F-measure on presence-background data) is highest.
  \item sensitivity: Threshold based on a specified sensitivity value.
  Usage thr = c('sensitivity', sens='0.6') or thr = c('sensitivity'). 'sens' refers to
   sensitivity value. If a sensitivity value is not specified, the default used is 0.9.
  }
In the case of use more than one threshold type it is necessary concatenate threshold types,
e.g., thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'max_jaccard'), or thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec',
'sensitivity', sens='0.8'), or thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity'). Function will
use all thresholds if no threshold is specified}

\item{metric}{character. Performance metric used for selecting the best combination of
hyper-parameter values. One of the following metrics can be used: SORENSEN, JACCARD, FPB,
TSS, KAPPA, AUC, and BOYCE. TSS is used as default.}

\item{n_cores}{numeric. Number of cores use for parallelization. Default 1}
}
\value{
A list object with:
\itemize{
\item model: A "ksvm" class object from kernlab package. This object can be used for predicting.
\item predictors: A tibble with quantitative (c column names) and qualitative (f column names)
 variables use for modeling.
\item performance: Hyper-parameters values and performance metric (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}})
for the best hyper-parameters combination.
\item performance_part: Performance metric for each replica and partition (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).
\item hyper_performance: Performance metrics (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}) for each combination
of the hyper-parameters.
\item data_ens: Predicted suitability for each test partition based on the best model. This database is used in \code{\link{fit_ensemble}}
