\usage{
esm_max(
  data,
  response,
  predictors,
  partition,
  thr = NULL,
  background = NULL,
  clamp = TRUE,
  classes = "default",
  pred_type = "cloglog",

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame. Database with the response (0,1) and predictors values.}

\item{response}{character. Column name with species absence-presence data (0,1)}

\item{predictors}{character. Vector with the column names of quantitative
predictor variables (i.e. continuous variables). This function can only construct models with continuous variables, and does not allow categorical variables
Usage predictors = c("aet", "cwd", "tmin").}

\item{partition}{character. Column name with training and validation partition groups.}

\item{thr}{character. Threshold used to get binary suitability values (i.e. 0,1). It is useful for threshold-dependent performance metrics. It is possible to use more than one threshold type. It is necessary to provide a vector for this argument. The following threshold criteria are available:
\itemize{
  \item equal_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sensitivity and specificity are equal.
  \item max_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is the highest (aka threshold that maximizes the TSS).
  \item max_jaccard: The threshold at which Jaccard is the highest.
  \item max_sorensen: The threshold at which Sorensen is highest.
  \item max_fpb: The threshold at which FPB (F-measure on presence-background data) is highest.
  \item sensitivity: Threshold based on a specified sensitivity value.
  Usage thr = c('sensitivity', sens='0.6') or thr = c('sensitivity'). 'sens' refers to sensitivity value. If no sensitivity value is specified, the default is 0.9
  }
If the user wants to include more than one threshold type, it is necessary concatenate threshold types, e.g., thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'max_jaccard'), or thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity', sens='0.8'), or thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity'). Function will use all thresholds if no threshold is specified.}

\item{background}{data.frame. Database with response column only with 0 and predictors variables. All
column names must be consistent with data. Default NULL}

\item{clamp}{logical. It is set with TRUE, predictors and features are restricted to the range seen during model training.}

\item{classes}{character. A single feature of any combinations of them. Features are symbolized by letters: l (linear), q (quadratic), h (hinge), p (product), and t (threshold). Usage classes = "lpq". Default "default" (see details).}

\item{pred_type}{character. Type of response required available "link", "exponential", "cloglog" and "logistic". Default "cloglog"}

\item{regmult}{numeric. A constant to adjust regularization. Because ESM are used
for modeling species with few records default value is 2.5}
}
\value{
A list object with:
\itemize{
\item esm_model: A list with "maxnet" class object from maxnet package for each bivariate model. This object can be used
for predicting ensembles of small models with \code{\link{sdm_predict}} function.
\item predictors: A tibble with variables use for modeling.
\item performance: Performance metrics (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).
Those threshold dependent metric are calculated based on the threshold specified in the argument.
\item performance_part: Performance metric for each replica and partition (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).

\description{
This function constructs Maxent Models using the
Ensemble of Small Model (ESM) approach (Breiner et al., 2015, 2018).
}
\details{
This method consists of creating bivariate models with all the pair-wise combinations
of predictors and perform an ensemble based on the average of suitability weighted by
Somers' D metric (D = 2 x (AUC -0.5)). ESM is recommended for modeling species with few occurrences.
This function does not allow categorical variables because the use of these types of variables
could be problematic when using with few occurrences. For further detail see
Breiner et al. (2015, 2018). This function use a default regularization multiplier
equal to 2.5 (see  Breiner et al., 2018)

When the argument “classes” is set as default MaxEnt will use different features combination
depending of the number of presences (np) with the follow rule:
if np < 10 classes = "l",
if np between 10  and 15 classes = "lq",
if np between 15 and 80 classes = "lqh",
and if np >= 80 classes = "lqph"

When presence-absence (or presence-pseudo-absence) data are used in data argument
in addition to background points, the function will fit models with presences and background
points and validate with presences and absences. This procedure makes maxent comparable to other
presences-absences models (e.g., random forest, support vector machine). If only presences and
background points data are used, function will fit and validate model with presences and
background data. If only presence-absences are used in data argument and without background,
function will fit model with the specified data (not recommended).
