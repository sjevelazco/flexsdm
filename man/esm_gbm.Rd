\usage{
esm_gbm(
  data,
  response,
  predictors,
  partition,
  thr = NULL,
  n_trees = 100,
  n_minobsinnode = NULL,
  shrinkage = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame. Database with the response (0,1) and predictors values.}

\item{response}{character. Column name with species absence-presence data (0,1)}

\item{predictors}{character. Vector with the column names of quantitative
predictor variables (i.e. continuous variables). This can only construct models with continuous variables and does not allow categorical variables.
Usage predictors = c("aet", "cwd", "tmin")}

\item{partition}{character. Column name with training and validation partition groups.}

\item{thr}{character. Threshold used to get binary suitability values (i.e. 0,1). It is useful for threshold-dependent performance metrics. It is possible to use more than one threshold type. It is necessary to provide a vector for this argument. The following threshold criteria are available:
\itemize{
  \item equal_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sensitivity and specificity are equal.
  \item max_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is the highest (aka threshold that maximizes the TSS).
  \item max_jaccard: The threshold at which the Jaccard index is the highest.
  \item max_sorensen: The threshold at which the Sorensen index is highest.
  \item max_fpb: The threshold at which FPB  (F-measure on presence-background data) is highest.
  \item sensitivity: Threshold based on a specified sensitivity value.
  Usage thr = c('sensitivity', sens='0.6') or thr = c('sensitivity'). 'sens' refers to sensitivity value. If a sensitivity value is not specified, the default value is 0.9.
  }
In the case of use more than one threshold type it is necessary concatenate threshold types, e.g., thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'max_jaccard'), or thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity', sens='0.8'), or thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity'). Function will use all thresholds if no threshold is specified.}

\item{n_trees}{Integer specifying the total number of trees to fit.
This is equivalent to the number of iterations and the number of basis
functions in the additive expansion. Default is 100.}

\item{n_minobsinnode}{Integer specifying the minimum number of
observations in the terminal nodes of the trees. Note that this
is the actual number of observations, not the total weight. If n_minobsinnode is NULL,
this parameter will assume a value equal to nrow(data)*0.5/4. Default is NULL.}

\item{shrinkage}{Numeric. This parameter applied to each tree in the
expansion. Also known as the learning rate or step-size reduction;
0.001 to 0.1 usually works, but a smaller learning rate typically
requires more trees. Default is 0.1.}
}
\value{
A list object with:
\itemize{
\item esm_model: A list with "gbm" class object from gbm package for each bivariate model. This object can be used
for predicting ensembles of small models with \code{\link{sdm_predict}} function.
\item predictors: A tibble with variables use for modeling.
\item performance: Performance metrics (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).
Threshold dependent metrics are calculated based on the threshold specified in thr argument.
\item performance_part: Performance metric for each replica and partition (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).

\description{
This function constructs Generalized Boosted Regression using the
Ensembles of Small Models (ESM) approach (Breiner et al., 2015, 2018).
}
\details{
This method consists of creating bivariate models with all the pair-wise combinations
of predictors and perform an ensemble based on the average of suitability weighted by
Somers' D metric (D = 2 x (AUC -0.5)). ESM is recommended for modeling species with few occurrences.
This function does not allow categorical variables because the use of these types of variables
could be problematic when using with few occurrences. For further detail see
Breiner et al. (2015, 2018).
