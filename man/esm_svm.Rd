\usage{
esm_svm(
  data,
  response,
  predictors,
  partition,
  thr = NULL,
  sigma = "automatic",
  C = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame. Database with the response (0,1) and predictors values.}

\item{response}{character. Column name with species absence-presence data (0,1).}

\item{predictors}{character. Vector with the column names of quantitative
predictor variables (i.e. continuous variables). This function only can construct models with continuous variables and does not allow categorical variables.
Usage predictors = c("aet", "cwd", "tmin").}

\item{partition}{character. Column name with training and validation partition groups.}

\item{thr}{character. Threshold used to get binary suitability values (i.e. 0,1). It is useful for threshold-dependent performance metrics. It is possible to use more than one threshold type. It is necessary to provide a vector for this argument. The following threshold criteria are available:
\itemize{
  \item equal_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sensitivity and specificity are equal.
  \item max_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is the highest (aka threshold that maximizes the TSS).
  \item max_jaccard: The threshold at which the Jaccard index is the highest.
  \item max_sorensen: The threshold at which the Sorensen index is highest.
  \item max_fpb: The threshold at which FPB (F-measure on presence-background data) is highest.
  \item sensitivity: Threshold based on a specified sensitivity value.
  Usage thr = c('sensitivity', sens='0.6') or thr = c('sensitivity'). 'sens' refers to sensitivity value. If a sensitivity value is not specified, the default is 0.9
  }
If the user wants to include more than one threshold type, it is necessary concatenate threshold types, e.g., thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'max_jaccard'), or thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity', sens='0.8'), or thr=c('max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity'). Function will use all thresholds if no threshold is specified}

\item{sigma}{numeric. Inverse kernel width for the Radial Basis kernel function "rbfdot".
Default "automatic".}

\item{C}{numeric. Cost of constraints violation,  the 'C' constant of the regularization
term in the Lagrange formulation. Default 1}
}
\value{
A list object with:
\itemize{
\item esm_model: A list with "ksvm" class object for each bivariate model. This object can be used
for predicting ensemble of small model with \code{\link{sdm_predict}} function.
\item predictors: A tibble with variables use for modeling.
\item performance: Performance metric (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).
Those threshold dependent metric are calculated based on the threshold specified in thr argument.

\description{
This function constructs Support Vector Machine models using the
Ensembles of Small Models (ESM) approach (Breiner et al., 2015, 2018).
}
\details{
This method consists of creating bivariate models with all the pair-wise combinations
of predictors and perform an ensemble based on the average of suitability weighted by
Somers' D metric (D = 2 x (AUC -0.5)). ESM is recommended for modeling species with few occurrences.
This function does not allow categorical variables because the use of these types of variables
could be problematic when using with few occurrences. Further detail see
Breiner et al. (2015, 2018). This function constructs 'C-svc' classification type and uses
Radial Basis kernel "Gaussian" function (rbfdot). See details in \link[kernlab]{ksvm}
