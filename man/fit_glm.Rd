\usage{
fit_glm(
  data,
  response,
  predictors,
  predictors_f = NULL,
  select_pred = FALSE,
  partition = NULL,
  thr = NULL,
  fit_formula = NULL,
  poly = 2,
  inter_order = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame. Database with response (0,1) and predictors values.}

\item{response}{character. Column name with species absence-presence data (0,1).}

\item{predictors}{character. Vector with the column names of quantitative
predictor variables (i.e. continuous variables).
Usage predictors = c("aet", "cwd", "tmin")}

\item{predictors_f}{character. Vector with the column names of qualitative
predictor variables (i.e. ordinal or nominal variables type). Usage predictors_f = c("landform")}

\item{select_pred}{logical. Perform predictor selection.
If TRUE predictors will be selected based on backward step wise approach. Default FALSE.}

\item{partition}{character. Column name with training and validation partition groups.
If partition = NULL, the model will be validated with the same data used for fitting.}

\item{thr}{character. Threshold used to get binary suitability values (i.e. 0,1), needed for threshold-dependent performance metrics. More than one threshold type can be used. It is necessary to provide a vector for this argument. The following threshold criteria are available:
\itemize{
  \item lpt: The highest threshold at which there is no omission.
  \item equal_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sensitivity and specificity are equal.
  \item max_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is the highest (aka threshold that maximizes the TSS).
  \item max_jaccard: The threshold at which the Jaccard index is the highest.
  \item max_sorensen: The threshold at which the Sorensen index is highest.
  \item max_fpb: The threshold at which FPB (F-measure on presence-background data) is highest.
  \item sensitivity: Threshold based on a specified sensitivity value.
  Usage thr = c('sensitivity', sens='0.6') or thr = c('sensitivity'). 'sens' refers to sensitivity value. If it is not specified a sensitivity values, function will use by default 0.9
  }
If more than one threshold type is used they must be concatenated, e.g., thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'max_jaccard'), or thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity', sens='0.8'), or thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity'). Function will use all thresholds if no threshold is specified.}

\item{fit_formula}{formula. A formula object with response and predictor
variables (e.g. formula(pr_ab ~ aet + ppt_jja + pH + awc + depth + landform)).
Note that the variables used here must be consistent with those used in
response, predictors, and predictors_f arguments}

\item{poly}{integer >= 2. If used with values >= 2 model will use polynomials
for those continuous variables (i.e. used in predictors argument). Default is 0.}

\item{inter_order}{integer >= 0. The interaction order between explanatory variables. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
A list object with:
\itemize{
\item model: A "glm" class object from stats package. This object can be used for predicting.
\item predictors: A tibble with quantitative (c column names) and qualitative (f column names) variables use for modeling.
\item performance: Performance metrics (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).
Threshold dependent metric are calculated based on the threshold specified in thr argument.
\item performance_part: Performance metric for each replica and partition (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).
\item data_ens: Predicted suitability for each test partition. This database is used in \code{\link{fit_ensemble}}
