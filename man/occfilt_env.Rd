\title{Perform environmental filtering on species occurrences}
\usage{
occfilt_env(data, x, y, id, env_layer, nbins)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame. Data.frame or tibble object with presences
(or presence-absence) records, and coordinates}

\item{x}{character. Column name with spatial x coordinates}

\item{y}{character. Column name with spatial y coordinates}

\item{id}{character. Column names with rows id. It is important that each row has its own unique code.}

\item{env_layer}{SpatRaster. Raster variables that will be used to fit the model. Factor variables will be removed.}

\item{nbins}{integer. A number of classes used to split each environmental condition. It is possible to use single or several values.
If several values are provided, the function will return a list with the results. Usage nbins =  5 or nbins = c(5, 10, 15)}
}
\value{
If one value is used to filter occurrence funtion will return a tibble object with filtered data. If several
values are used to filter occurrences, the function will return a list of tibbles with filtered data.
}
\description{
This function perform filtering on species occurrences based on their environmental conditions.
}
\details{
This function uses an approach adapted from the approach proposed by Varela et al. (2014).
 It consists of filtering occurrences in  environmental space. First, a regular
 multidimensional grid is created in  environmental space. This multidimensional
 grid is determined by the environmental variables (always use continuous variables) the
 grid cell size is defined by the number of bins, used for dividing variable range into
 interval classes (Varela et al. 2014; Castellanos et al., 2019). The number of bins is set in
 the "nbins" argument. Then, a single occurrence is randomly selected within each cell of the
 multidimensional grid. Consider that there is a trade-off between the number of bins and the number
 of filtered records because as the number of bins decreases, the cell size of the grids
 increases, and the number of filtered records decreases (Castellanos et al., 2019).
 occfilt_env works for any number of dimensions (variables) and with the original variables
 without performing a PCA beforehand.

 The greater the number of predictor variables (i.e., the number of dimensions of the
 multidimensional environmental grid) and the greater the number of bins, the greater the time processing
 and the computer memory used. Therefore, it is recommended to use a small number of bins
 between 2-5 if more than ten variables are used.

 Environmental filters are sensitive to the number of bins. A procedure for selecting the number
 of bins was used by Velazco et al. (2020) and it is implemented in \code{\link{occfilt_geo}}.
