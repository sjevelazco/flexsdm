  response,
  predictors,
  predictors_f = NULL,
  fit_formula = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame. Database with response (0,1) and predictors values.}

\item{response}{character. Column name with species absence-presence data (0,1).}

\item{predictors}{character. Vector with the column names of quantitative
predictor variables (i.e. continuous variables).
Usage predictors = c("aet", "cwd", "tmin")}

\item{predictors_f}{character. Vector with the column names of qualitative
predictor variables (i.e. ordinal or nominal variables type). Usage predictors_f = c("landform")}

\item{fit_formula}{formula. A formula object with response and predictor
variables. See maxnet.formula function from maxnet package.
Note that the variables used here must be consistent with those used in
response, predictors, and predictors_f arguments. Default NULL.}

\item{partition}{character. Column name with training and validation partition groups.}

\item{background}{data.frame. Database including only those rows with 0 values in the response column and the predictors variables. All
column names must be consistent with data. Default NULL}

\item{thr}{character. Threshold used to get binary suitability values (i.e. 0,1), needed for threshold-dependent performance metrics. More than one threshold type can be used. It is necessary to provide a vector for this argument. The following threshold criteria are available:
\itemize{
  \item lpt: The highest threshold at which there is no omission.
  \item equal_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sensitivity and specificity are equal.
  \item max_sens_spec: Threshold at which the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is the highest (aka threshold that maximizes the TSS).
  \item max_jaccard: The threshold at which the Jaccard index is the highest.
  \item max_sorensen: The threshold at which the Sorensen index is highest.
  \item max_fpb: The threshold at which FPB (F-measure on presence-background data) is highest.
  \item sensitivity: Threshold based on a specified sensitivity value.
  Usage thr = c('sensitivity', sens='0.6') or thr = c('sensitivity'). 'sens' refers to sensitivity value. If  a sensitivity values is not specified the default used is 0.9.
  }
If more than one threshold type is used they must be concatenated, e.g., thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'max_jaccard'), or thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity', sens='0.8'), or thr=c('lpt', 'max_sens_spec', 'sensitivity'). Function will use all thresholds if no threshold is specified.}

\item{clamp}{logical. If TRUE, predictors and features are restricted to the range seen during model training.}

\item{classes}{character. A single feature of any combinations of them. Features are symbolized by letters: l (linear), q (quadratic), h (hinge), p (product), and t (threshold). Usage classes = "lpq". Default "default" (see details).}

\item{pred_type}{character. Type of response required available "link", "exponential", "cloglog" and "logistic". Default "cloglog"}

\item{regmult}{numeric. A constant to adjust regularization. Default 1.}
}
\value{
A list object with:
\itemize{
\item model: A "maxnet" class object from maxnet package. This object can be used for predicting.
\item predictors: A tibble with quantitative (c column names) and qualitative (f column names) variables use for modeling.
\item performance: Performance metrics (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).
Threshold dependent metrics are calculated based on the threshold specified in thr argument.
\item performance_part: Performance metric for each replica and partition (see \code{\link{sdm_eval}}).
\item data_ens: Predicted suitability for each test partition based on the best model. This database is used in \code{\link{fit_ensemble}}
}

\description{
Fit and validate Maximum Entropy models
}
\details{
When the argument “classes” is set as default MaxEnt will use different features combination
depending of the number of presences (np) with the follow rule:
 if np < 10 classes = "l",
 if np between 10  and 15 classes = "lq",
 if np between 15 and 80 classes = "lqh",
 and if np >= 80 classes = "lqph"

When presence-absence (or presence-pseudo-absence) data are used in data argument
in addition to background points, the function will fit models with presences and background
points and validate with presences and absences. This procedure makes maxent comparable to other
presences-absences models (e.g., random forest, support vector machine). If only presences and
background points data are used, function will fit and validate model with presences and
background data. If only presence-absences are used in data argument and without background,
function will fit model with the specified data (not recommended).
